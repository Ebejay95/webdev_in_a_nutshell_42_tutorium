What does REST stand for in the context of web services?
Responsive State Transfer
Remote System Transfer
Representational State Transfer
Resource State Transform
3
REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for distributed systems designed by Roy Fielding.
Which HTTP method should be used to retrieve a resource in a RESTful API?
POST
GET
PUT
DELETE
2
GET is used to retrieve/read resources and should not modify any data on the server.
What is the primary purpose of the HTTP POST method in REST?
To update existing resources
To create new resources
To delete resources
To retrieve resources
2
POST is primarily used to create new resources on the server, though it can be used for other purposes in non-RESTful contexts.
Which HTTP status code indicates a successful resource creation in REST?
200 OK
201 Created
204 No Content
202 Accepted
2
201 Created is the proper status code to return when a new resource has been successfully created on the server.
What does the term 'stateless' mean in REST architecture?
The server stores all client states
Each request contains all necessary information
The client cannot maintain state
Resources never change state
2
In REST, each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand and process the request, without relying on stored context.
Which HTTP method is idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request?
POST
PATCH
PUT
DELETE
3
PUT is idempotent - making the same PUT request multiple times should have the same effect as making it once.
What is a URI in REST architecture?
Universal Response Identifier
Uniform Resource Indicator
Uniform Resource Identifier
Universal Resource Implementation
3
URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is used to identify resources in a REST system, often in the form of URLs.
Which status code should be returned when a requested resource is not found?
400 Bad Request
401 Unauthorized
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
4
404 Not Found is the appropriate status code when the requested resource doesn't exist on the server.
What does HATEOAS stand for in REST architecture?
Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State
Hypertext Application Transfer Of Active States
High Availability Text Engine Of Application Services
Hypertext Active Transfer Engine Of Application State
1
HATEOAS is a REST constraint meaning clients interact with the application entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by servers.
Which HTTP method should be used to completely update a resource in REST?
PATCH
POST
PUT
UPDATE
3
PUT is used for complete updates of a resource, replacing the entire resource with the new representation.
What is the purpose of the HTTP PATCH method in REST?
To create new resources
To partially modify resources
To delete resources
To retrieve resources
2
PATCH is used for partial modifications to a resource, unlike PUT which replaces the entire resource.
Which HTTP status code range indicates server errors?
200-299
300-399
400-499
500-599
4
5xx status codes indicate server-side errors, where the server failed to fulfill a valid request.
What is the main purpose of caching in REST?
To reduce server load and improve performance
To ensure data consistency
To validate user credentials
To compress data transmission
1
Caching helps improve performance and scalability by storing copies of responses closer to clients.
How should related resources be represented in a RESTful API?
Through complex query parameters
Through hypermedia links
Through separate API versions
Through custom HTTP methods
2
Related resources should be represented through hypermedia links, following the HATEOAS principle.
What does the HTTP status code 415 indicate?
Unsupported Media Type
Method Not Allowed
Bad Gateway
Service Unavailable
1
415 Unsupported Media Type indicates the server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is unsupported.
What is the recommended way to version a RESTful API?
Using different HTTP methods
Using query parameters
Using URL path versioning
Using custom HTTP headers
3
While there are multiple approaches, URL path versioning (e.g., /v1/resources) is commonly used and easily understood.
Which principle states that REST should use a uniform interface?
Statelessness
Layered System
Client-Server
Uniform Interface
4
The Uniform Interface principle ensures standardization of communication between components.
What is the purpose of the OPTIONS HTTP method in REST?
To retrieve resource metadata
To update resources
To delete resources
To create resources
1
OPTIONS allows clients to discover which operations are supported for a resource through metadata.
What should be returned in response to a successful DELETE request?
200 OK with response body
204 No Content
201 Created
202 Accepted
2
A successful DELETE should return 204 No Content, as there is typically no body to return.
Which HTTP method is considered safe (read-only)?
POST
PUT
GET
DELETE
3
GET is considered safe because it should only retrieve data and not modify server state.
